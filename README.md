# EspressoCode was built with the [Tailwind Nextjs Starter Blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) blogging starter template. Probably the most feature rich nextjs markdown blogging template out there. I didn't build it and the readme comes from the template mostly. Comes out of the box configured with the latest technologies to make technical writing a breeze. Easily configurable and customizable.
