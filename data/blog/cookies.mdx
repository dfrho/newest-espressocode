<p>
  What's the big deal about cookies? HTTP cookies, aka "magic" cookies, are the handshake that makes
  communicating between a server and a client possible. In this article we'll explore exactly what
  they are, why they are used, and how they are made.
</p>

<h1>What's a Cookie?</h1>
<p>
  Cookies are small text files comprised of name/value pairs in a string. For example, you can set
  them in Javascript with:
</p>
``` document.cookie = "username=JohnDoe" ```
<p>
  Cookies are passed between server and client and upon return calls from client to server. And,
  cookies can be set or read server side, or client side (as long as the __httpOnly__ flag is set to
  "false"). You can view a browser's cookies by looking in your browser's dev tools under the
  **Applications** tab, **Storage** section:
</p>

<p>
  Lou Montulli, a web programmer for Netscape, came up with the cookie architecture in 1994 when he
  needed a way to remember their client MCI's e-commerce carts. Which leads to one of the main
  reasons why cookies were used...
</p>

<h1>Why Use Cookies?</h1>
<p>
  __Cookies have been used to enhance end web users' experience, by monitoring or remembering
  them.__ HTTP is designed as a stateless protocol, so state information is not retained between
  server calls by default. In the above MCI example, cookies served to remember the user's cart so
  they could return to a shopping experience later without it forgetting their items. Some other
  ways client side storage is used to enhance a user's web experience are:
</p>

- UI preferences, like light/dark mode;
- Authentication, or login;
- Authorization, aka role-based content access;
- Personalization
- Recommendations
- Tracking browser activity, purchases, product preferences, IP address, geolocation, etc. for more targeted advertising

<p>
  Cookies can be thought of as a coded wristband you're assigned at a music festival or amusement
  park. It can be used to match your identity, wallet, emergency contact, and purchase preferences
  -- all personal details designed to enhance your user experience.
</p>

<h1>Cookies vs. Sessions</h1>
<p>
  There's a distinction you may find helpful as cookies and sessions are very similar. The
  difference between cookies and sessions is simple: Cookies store user information on the
  __client__, and sessions store user information on the __server__. Session data is available for
  all pages served by the site. The reason you'd want to store information server-side is because
  you can validate it, therefore manipulate and sanitize it. 
  
  There are two ways to implement sessions:

1. Store everything on the cookie.
2. Store a unique ID in the cookie and the remaining data points on the server.

#2 is the recommended way to implement sessions.

</p>

<p>
  Notice in the dev tools image above in the **Storage** section there are multiple listings.
  _IndexedDB_, _Local Storage_, and _Session Storage_ APIs are increasingly used more than _Cookies_
  for storing user data client-side, while _Cookies_ are increasingly used more to store Session IDs
  because of size constraints (cookies only store 4kb). _Cookies_ are also limited in their total
  number and new ones replace oldest ones when the maximum number is reached.
</p>

<h1>Arguments Against Cookies</h1>
<p>
  Perhaps no other area of web architecture has been more hotly contested than that of cookies.
  Cookies that follow your behavior across the web have been known to track hundreds of data points
  about users, although nothing that's personally identifiable. The [Cambridge Analytica/Facebook
  Scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal) is a
  perfect example of such [targeted advertising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_advertising)
  gone horribly wrong.
</p>

<p>
  And cookies are one of the most commonly-exploited vectors for hackers. [Decoding
  cookies](https://latesthackingnews.com/2017/08/16/hacking-cookies/), [session
  hijacking](https://www.venafi.com/blog/what-session-hijacking#:~:text=Session%20hijacking%2C%20also%20known%20as,masquerading%20as%20the%20authorized%20user.),
  and [session fixation](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Session_fixation) are all ways
  cookies can be exploited to hack users.
</p>

<p>
  Government regulation has stepped in to ensure consumers are at least notified about cookies and
  the information tracked. The European Union instituted the
  [GDPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation), or General Data
  Protection Regulation, in 2018. In the same year, California passed the
  [CCPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Consumer_Privacy_Act), or California Consumer
  Privacy Act. Both cover the right-to-know what is being tracked and the right-to-opt-out of
  tracking. As a result, a cottage industry around compliance to the new regulations sprung up.
</p>

<h1>How to Set Cookies</h1>
<p>
  Cookies are passed between the server and client, and as such, can be set by the server or client.
  Your back-end can be coded in a variety of languages including PHP, Python, and Node.js. As a
  Javascript engineer, I'll use Node.js and Express. Express is a "Node application framework" that
  abstracts the building and maintenance of a Node.js server. Using Express, we can set, adjust, and
  delete cookies from each route. So let's create a bare-bones app to demonstrate how to work with
  cookies. First we'll install the libraries __express__, __dayjs__ and __cookie-parser__:
</p>

```
npm install express cookie-parser dayjs
```

<p>Then, in your project's __index.js__ file, let's set up the express boilerplate:</p>

```Javascript
const express = require("express")
const cookieParser = require("cookie-parser")
const dayjs = require("dayjs");
const app = express()
app.use(cookieParser())
```

<p>Then, set up the home route with a cookie:</p>

```Javascript
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.cookie("darkmode", "true", {
      secure: process.env.NODE_ENV !== "development",
      httpOnly: true,
      expires: dayjs().add(30, "days").toDate(),
    });

  res.send("Hello.");

})

app.listen(3000);
```

<p>
  A few things are happening here after setting up the server; I'll explain then illustrate how they
  show up in dev tools. First and most importantly, we're setting a cookie with the name/value pair
  of "darkmode"/"true". Then we are protecting that information by setting the __secure__ flag to a
  boolean depending on whether it's development mode or not (this is for learning purposes; we'd
  more than likely **not** protect UI information like dark mode!). Next, we're setting __httpOnly__
  to true to ensure there are no cross-site scripting attacks by guaranteeing the cookie can only be
  read by this client and server, no others. And finally, we're setting this cookie to the browser
  cache for 30 days with the __expires__ flag.
</p>

<p>
  Now run the app by entering ```node index.js``` in the console, and navigate your browser to
  ```http://localhost:3000/```. You should see "Hello" in the browser. Open dev tools and click on
  the **Application** tab, **Storage** section and you should see the flags set noted as below:
</p>

<h1>How to Read Cookies</h1>
<p>
  Two great libraries to use for reading cookies with Express are __cookie-parser__ and
  __express-cookie__. For learning purposes let's go under the hood though and demonstrate a helper
  function for setting all the request's cookies into an object with name/value properties:
</p>

```Javascript
const getCookies = (req) => {
  const cookies = req.headers.cookie.split('; ');
  const parsedCookies = {};

  cookies.forEach(rawCookie => {
    const parsedCookie = rawCookie.split('=');
    parsedCookies[parsedCookie[0]] = parsedCookie[1];
  });

  return parsedCookies;
};
```

<h1>How to Update Cookies</h1>
<p>
  Just update the property as the second parameter for the _res.cookie_ method. Note you need to
  include the previous options as the third object properties if you want to maintain them. Try the
  new route in your app and check dev tools to ensure the __darkmode__ property is set to false,
  while **HttpOnly** and **Secure** are checked.
</p>

```Javascript
app.get('/set_lightmode_cookie', function (req, res) {
  res.cookie('darkmode', 'false', {
    secure: process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'development',
    httpOnly: true,
    expires: dayjs().add(30, 'days').toDate(),
  });
  res.send('cookie lightmode set');
});
```

<h1>How to Delete Cookies</h1>
<p>
  Deleting Cookies with Express is easy. There are two approaches, deleting by value name, or deleting all. 
  __Deleting by value name:__
</p>
  
  ```Javascript
  app.get('/clear_darkmode_cookie', function (req, res) {
    res.clearCookie('darkmode');
    res.send('cookie darkmode cleared');
  });
  ```
<p>
  To delete __all__ cookies, just use the **clearCookie** method without a name parameter:
</p>
  ```Javascript
  res.clearCookie();
  ```
<p>You can then visit the route and check to ensure the cookies are indeed gone.</p>

<h1>Best Practices</h1>

- Avoid storing sensitive information, such as passwords, as cookies are stored in plain text.
- Restrict the cookie to only your application by using the **path** argument.
- Don't share with subdomains: Use the **domain** option.
- Only for secure connections: Using the **secure** option you can tell the browser (or other http clients) to only send the cookie over SSL connections.
- Protect against XSS exploits: The **httpOnly** flag is used to tell the browser that it should not allow Javascript to access the contents of the cookie.

<p>A typical snippet:</p>

```Javascript
res.cookie('name', 'Tobias', {
  domain: '.example.com',  // Domain name for cookie - Defaults to app domain name
  path: '/admin', // Path for the cookie - Defaults to '/'
  secure: true, // cookies will be sent to server only on https
  httpOnly: true // Javascript client cannot read this cookie
});
```

<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>
  Cookies are used to enhance the security and user experience of web users. While the root of
  controversy around privacy, recent legislative initiatives have provided some relief and will more
  than likely go global. Creating, reading, updating, and deleting cookies are easy with Express, a
  Node.js server framework. Nowadays, because of alternatives and storage contraints, cookies are
  used mostly for session IDs. Now you've got some answers when asked about cookies from an
  historic, architectural, and coding standpoint.
