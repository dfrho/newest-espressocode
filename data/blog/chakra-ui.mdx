  A few weeks ago I completed a great tutorial: This time it was [Build a Modern User Interface with
  Chakra UI](https://egghead.io/courses/build-a-modern-user-interface-with-chakra-ui-fac68106).
  Keeping with the J-school technique for outlining a story, the best way to relate what I learned
  about Chakra UI is by answering the questions **Who**, **What**, **Where**, **When**, and **Why**.
  Or, in more logical order: **What**, **Who**, **Why**, **Where**, and **When**.
</p>

<h1>What</h1>
<p>
  Chakra UI is a "simple, modular and accessible component library that gives you the building
  blocks you need to build your React applications." "Simple" in that it provides a great developer
  experience. "Modular", meaning the components are independent, self-contained units that can be
  put together to construct a more complex system.
</p>

<h1>Who</h1>
<p>
  Chakra UI was created by Segun Adebayo, a UX engineer, and is maintained by a team of 12 core
  engineers. The library, and tutorial, are for established React developers. So as long as you know
  how to build a to-do app in React, you'll learn a lot. You'll benefit even more if you've used
  libraries like **Bootstrap** or **Material UI** as the syntax is similar, although Chakra is more
  powerful.
</p>

<h1>Why</h1>
<p>
  Why learn Chakra UI? For starters, it's used in many projects and the skills are in demand.
  **488,000 downloads per month**, **22,300 Github stars**, and **2,900 Discord members**. It's so
  popular because it includes accesibility features for free, it's very themeable, you can compose
  new components easily, and the cherry on top: there's a light/dark mode feature. So basically
  you're getting a more powerful styling library that involves a little more work up front with less
  work and better developer experience later.
</p>
<p>
  If you're working in an enterprise org, you might find Chakra UI Pro worthwhile; It's a premium
  version of the library with more advanced components like Auth, Banner, and Product Details.
</p>

<h1>Where</h1>
<p>
  Chakra UI is used in web dev projects by individual developers, small businesses, and enterprise
  orgs like Shogun, Bonton, and LUGGit.
</p>

<h1>When</h1>
<p>
  Use Chakra UI whenever you have a branded theme or design system provided. It keeps your fonts,
  colors, margins, padding, etc. in one place and easily applied universally.
</p>

<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>
  That's Chakra UI from every angle. Chakra UI is a powerful library allowing you to consistently
  theme and even create themed components. It's well-covered by developers and becoming
  rapidly-accepted by the industry. Here's the [recommended
  tutorial](https://egghead.io/courses/build-a-modern-user-interface-with-chakra-ui-fac68106) again
  for anyone wanting to learn.
