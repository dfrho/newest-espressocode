## Are You Selling Tech to Developers?

The latest [StackOverflow Developer Survey](https://stackoverflow.blog/2024/07/24/developers-want-more-more-more-the-2024-results-from-stack-overflow-s-annual-developer-survey/) results are in, and they've got the scoop on what matters most to us. 🤔 As a fellow software engineer, I'm sharing some key takeaways to help **SaaS** sellers better understand our needs and concerns:

- 82% of developers learn to code using online resources, while only 49% learn in school 📚
- Technical documentation is the top resource for learning, followed closely by Stack Overflow 📊.
- Despite economic challenges, most developers are still full-stack or back-end engineers, with a growing proportion of those aged 35 and up
- **AI** is not seen as a threat to jobs, with 70% of professionals disagreeing and 62% already using AI tools 🤖. The top concern? Salary decreases, with median salaries dropping for certain positions, including **blockchain developers** and **site reliability engineers** 💸.

## What does this mean for SaaS sellers?

Focus on providing solutions that:

- Offer high-quality technical documentation and support
- Address any concerns around AI and job security
- Provide value in terms of time-saving and efficiency
- Cater to the growing demographic of older, more experienced developers

Some things to think about, tech to tech sellers! 📝 💻💡
